Marketing director **Ms. Sarah Speed**, a former cycling champ, has a plan to dominate the upcoming Seattle Bike Expo with a killer ad campaign on the bustling **Fremont Bridge**, where cyclists swarm daily. But Seattle’s wild weather and unpredictable rider patterns make timing and placement tricky. Armed with datasets on daily cyclist counts, you, the star data analyst, must uncover when and where to place ads to make CycleWorks the talk of the town!"
